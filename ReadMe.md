// one month ago i was decided to migration from `PHP / Laravel` to `Golang` 
// pure only for "API" integration between `Lisensijakon` and `Portal-Perizinin-PUPR`
// when i wrote this code, only god and i knew how it worked.
// now, only god knows it!

// therefore, if you are trying to `Refactor` and `Optimize` this code
